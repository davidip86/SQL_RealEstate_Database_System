# SQL Project - Real Estate Database System

## Objective
Design and implement a database using SQL for the MyHomes company.

## Company profile - MyHomes
MyHomes is a real estate company operating globally, their main area of business lies in buying and selling properties.
- The properties that the company deals in are of five types: houses, flats/apartments, bungalows, land, and commercial property. These properties may be subject to health and safety regulations, which govern how these properties must be build and maintained.
- Each property that MyHomes deals in is the main responsibility of one of the company’s area sales representatives.
- Each sales representative may be responsible for a number of different properties.
- A number of the area sales representatives act as supervisors.
- Supervisors are directly responsible for managing teams of fellow area sales representatives.
- An area sales representative may also be responsible for dealing with a number of MyHomes’s customers.
- Each of the company’s customers will only deal with MyHomes through one particular sales representative.
- Each sales representative also covers one or more geographical sales areas, for eliciting new business from prospective customers.
- A number of different sales representatives may cover the same geographical area, but there will always be a single sales representative who acts as the chief salesperson for that area, and who is directly responsible to management for sales performance in that area, in terms of hitting sales targets.
